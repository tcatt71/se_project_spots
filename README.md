# Spots

This is the HTML and CSS of a webpage for a fictional web app called Spots. Spots is a web application where users would be able to add photos to their profile and be able to like others photos as well. This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. This was created based on this [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1).
